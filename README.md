## Description

A simple web application for blog site created using SpringBoot for backend as Maven project which integrates MySQL for database connection and AngularJS for frontend.

People can create account to add blogs.

- The app is created following Uncle Bob's clean code philosophy as much as possible.
- implemented Spring MVC architecture.
- Spring Security features for login/signup.
- Also uses JWT token based authorization feature.

## Use Case Diagram

![Use Case Diagram](src/main/resources/images/Use_case_diagram_for_blogsite.jpg)

A use case diagram is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and different types of users the system has and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses. The user's interactions with the system are represented by arrows.

A use case diagram doesn't go into a lot of detailâ€”for example, don't expect it to model the order in which steps are performed. Instead, a proper use case diagram depicts a high-level overview of the relationship between use cases, actors, and systems.

## DFD-0 and DFD-1 with ERD & data schema and annotations

- **Database schema** is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system.

- **Entity relationship diagram (ERD)**, also known as an entity relationship model, is a graphical representation that depicts relationships among people, objects, places, concepts or events within an information technology (IT) system.

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** provides a visual representation of the flow of information (i.e. data) within a system. By drawing a Data Flow Diagram, you can tell the information provided by and delivered to someone who takes part in system processes, the information needed to complete the processes and the information needed to be stored and accessed.

  - DFD-0 (Context DFD):

    A context diagram is a data flow diagram that only shows the top level, otherwise known as Level 0. At this level, there is only one visible process node that represents the functions of a complete system in regards to how it interacts with external entities.

    Some of the benefits of a Context Diagram are:

    - Shows the overview of the boundaries of a system
    - No technical knowledge is required to understand with the simple notation
    - Simple to draw, amend and elaborate as its limited notation.
      <br/><br/>

  - DFD-1 (System DFD):

   DFD Level 1 provides a more detailed breakout of pieces of the Context Level Diagram. You will highlight the main functions carried out by the system, as you break down the high-level process of the Context Diagram into its subprocesses.
